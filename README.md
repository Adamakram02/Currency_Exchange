# Project Idea
The user enters the names and symbols of currencies,then determines the value of each currency in relation to another currency,and the value can be modified after setting it. 

Then the customer enters the value that he wants to convert to another currency, and we enter the value and it returns to the value of the currencies that the customer wants to convert to. 
There is a small addition, which is moving the mouse. On the screen horizontally and vertically as shown in the video.
